    Project Title: Last Offer

    Description: This is a little game I thought of. I think, the idea is from a radio show I heard as a small kid once. I will create it in Python.
      Basically, you get a fictional cash offer and you can either take it or not. The offer will increase every time but if you go to far, you will get shot.

    Installation Instructions: You just need the main.py file and then run it. As of now, you also need the pandas library.
    
    Usage: Recreation

    Contributing: not necessary

    License: none

    Contact Information: none

    Acknowledgments: Me and that radio show if it wasn't a dream.
